Read Me-Code Fellows Bootcamp: Race Simulation

This game was coded and designed by Sam Hamm and Monica Davidson. The game allows the user to choose two classmates for the Code Fellows Bootcamp 26 class to race against one another. Each classmate has it's own properties; speed and focus. Both speed and focus range from 1 to 5. 1 being slow or having low focus and 5 being fast and having high focus. The user chooses the properties for each classmate and then clicks the race button to see the game play out in a text box.
